<p><strong>Introduction to Node.js and Express</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I explored the fundamentals of Node.js and Express, focusing on how to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server, complemented by various built-in modules for different functionalities. Express, a widely-used web application framework, simplifies server creation and routing management.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime that allows the execution of JavaScript on the server-side, equipped with built-in modules such as HTTP and File System.</li>
  <li><strong>Express:</strong> A lightweight framework for Node.js that facilitates the creation of servers and handling routing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Creating a Server:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to set up a basic server using Node.js.</li>
      <li>Implemented a simple HTTP server to handle incoming requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Serving Files:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized the File System module to read and serve static files.</li>
      <li>Enabled serving different types of content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the client.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Handling Requests:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Managed different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to respond to browser requests.</li>
      <li>Used Express to streamline routing and make server-side code more manageable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Routing with Express:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up routes to handle requests for various endpoints (e.g., /home, /blog).</li>
      <li>Implemented middleware in Express to handle requests and responses efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
